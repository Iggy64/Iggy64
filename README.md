- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Iggy64
- ðŸ‘€ I have been running various Linux-based operating systems on an array of home computers for a couple of decades.  I haven't done any coding for many, many years.
- I frequently visit GitHub to get a look at where certain applications originate, and how they develop/fork over time.  This has proven quite helpful in solving
issues and making better use of the software.
- Sometimes I'd like to reach out to a developer with feedback or questions.  So I thought it high time a register here and perhaps get a little more involved, 
at least from the feedback side.
